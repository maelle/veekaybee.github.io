I was home with two kids of a good chunk of the year and worried that the world was ending the rest of the time. When I did read, I wanted to read things where people who were competent solved problems. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to read about (unattainable) travel or anything that felt like life moving foward, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to read anything about the apocalypse.</description></item><item><title>What we've lost</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2020-12-24-what-weve-lost/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2020-12-24-what-weve-lost/</guid><description>This started as a Twitter thread, but one of my long-time goals has been to not put stuff in Twitter threads, so here it is in longer form. Hopefully this is the start of a nice return to blogging for 2021!
A few days ago, I was putting together our physical photo album for 2020. I do this every year because I&amp;rsquo;m terrified that I&amp;rsquo;m going to lose all of our photos into the digital ether.</description></item><item><title>How the headphone jack-less iPhone came to be</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2018-11-05-dongles/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2018-11-05-dongles/</guid><description>It so happened that one morning the devil was stuck in an Uber Pool down 101 from the city to Menlo Park (he was late for a meeting with the Facebook content moderation team,) when the driver suddenly took a huge detour and stopped at a leafy driveway in Atherton.
Phil Schiller emerged, wearing a slightly rumpled shirt and holding two iPhones in each hand. Another stuck out haphazardly from his back pocket.</description></item><item><title>Dear Facebook user 752461218193242</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2018-03-30-dear-facebook-user/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2018-03-30-dear-facebook-user/</guid><description>Apologies to Roy Lichtenstein
According to my Facebook data dump, Mark Zuckerberg knows my birthday, all 40 of my interests, my wedding anniversary, and that time in 2011 that I checked in at a castle in Scotland.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been a Facebook user since it became available to public universities in 2004 - almost fifteen years of my life and countless hours of effort have been put into status boxes, photo updates, and checkins.</description></item><item><title>It didn't taste like Pamplemousse</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2018-02-18-pamplemousse/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Feb 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2018-02-18-pamplemousse/</guid><description>Everyone I know has been talking about LaCroix. The hipster sparkling water has been everywhere lately, from tech startups, to the millennial female-oriented newsletter I subscribe to to pretend I&amp;rsquo;m still in my 20s and see what all the kids are up to these days.
Recently, I decided to try it and see if I could indeed ascend to a higher spiritual plane while drinking it. I went specifically to my local Whole Foods, where they are super-heavy on selling the stuff recently, picked out a six-pack, and brought it home.</description></item><item><title>Strava and the boat in the data lake</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2018-01-30-strava/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2018-01-30-strava/</guid><description>Dutch Fishing Boats in a Storm, JMW Turner
Several years ago, I wrote that the Snowden revelations changed the way I understood the internet.
I wrote then, that,
I spend a large majority of my day swimming in the sea of data online. I go to Facebook, Twitter, email, weather, this blog, and everywhere else. In the past, I’ve considered this world mine, safe and managed by me, as long as I was smart and sensible.</description></item><item><title>My Favorite Books of 2017</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2018-01-02-favorite-books/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2018-01-02-favorite-books/</guid><description>Every year, it seems like the books I read are completely random. But, what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned over time is that I love books that teach me something about the invisible systems that govern how the world works.
My first revelation was many years ago, when I first read Confessions of an Economic Hitman and understood better how international financial systems really work under the covers. Ever since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve been on the look out for both fiction and non-fiction books that peel back the curtain and show the world for what it really is.</description></item><item><title>Logs populi or, Thanks, Netflix!</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2017-12-14-logs-populi/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Dec 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2017-12-14-logs-populi/</guid><description>Earlier this week, Netflix tweeted out a seemingly-innocuous throw-away joke about how comforting it is to watch terrible Lifetime-like movies.
The tweet immediately went viral, but not for the reason Netflix probably imagined. In the process of Brand Building, the company ultimately revealed that it was not above exposing proprietary customer viewing data to hundreds of thousands of people on Twitter for quick laughs.
There is a small caveat: having worked previously with streaming viewing data, I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely convinced the data in the tweet was real.</description></item><item><title>The demise of SoundCloud</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2017-08-11-soundcloud/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2017-08-11-soundcloud/</guid><description>They listen to the gramophone, Makovsky
The winter of 2005 was not easy. I was a sophomore in college, taking a heavy courseload, with a scholarship contingent on grades, and finals were right around the corner. I was also working two jobs. It was cold and dark in State College, Pennsylvania. My roommate and I didn&amp;rsquo;t get along - she wrote a public blog post detailing everything that annoyed her about me, including the fact that I was a loud chewer.</description></item><item><title>We know the way</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2017-06-27-moana/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2017-06-27-moana/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s 10:37 PM on a Wednesday night, and I should be asleep. But I&amp;rsquo;m lying on the edge of my bed at an extremely uncomfortable angle, watching this video with the sound softly turned down so Mr. B, who is downstairs, doesn&amp;rsquo;t hear my secret shame.

I cannot express how much joy this video clip, set to this song, brings me. Each time I watch it, I become more hopeful and jubilant about the idea of self-determination, hard work, and human progress.</description></item><item><title>Talk at Skeptech - Manuscripts don't burn</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2017-06-19-skeptech/</link><pubDate>Fri, 09 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2017-06-19-skeptech/</guid><description>In April, I gave a talk at Skeptech, a fantastic event put together by Mark Hurst to question what the internet&amp;rsquo;s become lately.
The video of the talk is here. My section starts around 1:12:00, but I really encourage you to listen to all of it.
Thank you to WFMU for hosting.
This is the transcript I wrote for my speaker&amp;rsquo;s notes. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t 100% match up with what I talked about, but follows the spirit of the talk.</description></item><item><title>Good things don't scale</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2017-05-10-good-things-dont-scale/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2017-05-10-good-things-dont-scale/</guid><description>Table of Contents

Last year, with a newborn and a new job, I had zero time for, or interest in, reading. It was like my brain turned off. This year, the toddler started going to bed at 7:30 and sleeping through the night, and I swam in literature. I luxuriated over having hours and hours of uninterrupted time at night to read books.</description></item><item><title>Fix the internet by writing good stuff and being nice to people</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2016-11-20-fix-the-internet/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Nov 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2016-11-20-fix-the-internet/</guid><description>Today&amp;rsquo;s internet is mean. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to pinpoint exactly when everyone online became a jerk, but to me it seems that the tipping point occurred right when making money off content started being worth more than the content itself. I wrote the following post before the election but never got around to publishing it. Now, it seems more necessary than ever.

When I was twelve, my family had been in America for seven years, and we could finally afford the American Dream. My parents sold our tiny, grimy duplex in exchange for a larger house in a much better school district.</description></item><item><title>Diaper by diaper and bottle by bottle</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2015-10-07-diaper-by-diaper-and-bottle-by-bottle/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Oct 2015 07:20:28 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2015-10-07-diaper-by-diaper-and-bottle-by-bottle/</guid><description>I am reading about someone who has a lot of followers on Twitter. She just had a baby, and I am outraged. “Can you believe this,” I say to Mr. B. “She writes that childbirth was ‘beautiful,’ and that she’ll be offline for a bit because she, her husband, and her baby will be ‘falling in love with each other’ for the foreseeable future. ”
Mr. B looks up from his computer.</description></item><item><title>How to think in two languages</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2015-08-07-how-to-think-in-two-languages/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Aug 2015 07:29:51 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2015-08-07-how-to-think-in-two-languages/</guid><description>This is one in what looks like is becoming a series of posts in how I reconcile growing up mostly in America but wanting to raise my child in Russian.
I need to get something off my chest.
I’ve never read War and Peace. Or Anna Karenina. Or The Brothers Karamazov.
In all the years I’ve been pretending to be an expert on Russian culture, I’ve never read any of the great works of Russian literature.</description></item><item><title>Reddit was amazing</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2015-06-11-reddit-was-amazing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2015 11:56:37 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2015-06-11-reddit-was-amazing/</guid><description>In its early years, the Soviet Union was not like what we think of the Soviet Union today: closed, totalitarian, single-minded. The fresh, new feel of the revolution made Russia feel like a whole new world for artists and writers alike. The government, just a baby itself and energized by this brave new world it had created, pushed for many progressive ideas. In addition to banning private property, it also gave women equal rights to men under marriage, legalized abortion, and gave legitimacy to children born out of wedlock.</description></item><item><title>What do we do with all these photos?</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2015-06-03-what-do-we-do-with-all-these-photos/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jun 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2015-06-03-what-do-we-do-with-all-these-photos/</guid><description>When I go to visit my grandfather, I often enjoy looking at our family photo album. He was born in the 1930s in the Soviet Union and the pictures start sometime in the 1950s, when he married my grandmother, and go all the way up to today.
That photo album survived 40 years in communism, three apartments, a trans-Atlantic move to the United States, and two moves in Philadelphia. There are maybe 300 pictures in the album, and every single one of them is interesting.</description></item><item><title>It is hard to talk to my baby in Russian</title><link>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2015-05-28-it-is-hard-to-talk-to-my-baby-in-russian/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 May 2015 07:56:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://veekaybee.github.io/essays/2015-05-28-it-is-hard-to-talk-to-my-baby-in-russian/</guid><description>There is a meme going around the internet that is a picture with two eggs on it. The first, on the left, is a whole egg, round and white and smooth. The second, on the right, is the egg smashed into tiny bits and pieces. The whole egg is your brain before kids, and the right egg is your brain after kids.
I’ve found this to be accurate. Before I thought about all kinds of esoteric things, like the Kurdish oil region in Iraq, random blogs I used to read three years ago (what happened to Gubbi of Arabia?</description></item></channel></rss>
